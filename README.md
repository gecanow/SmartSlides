### Navigating the SmartSlides site
Once your presentation is loaded into the project folder (either via SmartSlidesBegin or manually), you can get started by navigating the localhost:8000, clickingg 'Yes' if the slide thumbnails are correct, and clicking 'Customize' to start customizing.

On the customization page, you can add new custom voice or gesture commands. Custom gesture commands are currently in beta. 

When you are ready to present, click 'Present'.
